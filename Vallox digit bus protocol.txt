1 Common
DIGIT's communication between the modules is based on a bus implemented with a secure twisted pair, where the communication takes place as RS 485 serial communication. The RS 485 design allows a maximum of 32 modules, each containing both a transmitter and a receiver.
2. Data transmission
                 DIGIT communication is based on two-way RS 485 serial communication.
                 9600 bps, no parity (N), 8 data bits, 1 STOP bit.
3. Protocol
3.1 Request / response service principle
The structure of the request / response principle is shown in Figure 1. The module requesting information (requester) determines from which module the information is desired by setting the content of the RECEIVER variable to the module address of the destination. The requester sets the contents of the REQUEST variable to 0 for the information request. What information the requester wants is indicated by setting the content of the VARIABLE variable to the address of the register from which the information is requested.
All modules (except the requester) listen on the bus and the module whose module address corresponds to the contents of the RECEIVER variable forms a response packet in which the DATA variable contains the response to the sent request. This response packet is sent back to the requester.

The requester waits for a response for a maximum of 10 ms. If the answer is no. time come, send the requester the request packet again and wait again for the max. 10 ms. If 10 responses are not received during the request / wait period, the requesting module enters fault mode.
The request / response principle is used when transferring information from the recipient to the requester, for example when the remote control requests one of the setpoints from the host motherboard.
The request / reply principle is used when transferring information from the recipient to the requester, for example, when the remote control asks the host motherboard for one of the setpoints.
3.2 End-to-end acknowledged service
The structure of the send / acknowledge principle is shown in Figure 2. The module sending the information determines to which module the information is to be sent by setting the content of the RECEIVER variable to the module address of the destination. What information the sender sends is indicated by setting the contents of the VARIABLE variable to the address of the register whose information is sent. The actual information is set in the DATA variable.
All modules (except the sender) listen to the bus and the module whose module address corresponds to the contents of the RECEIVER variable acknowledges the checksum of the received packet.

The sender waits for an acknowledgment for a maximum of 10 ms. If the acknowledgment does not time to come, resend the packet and wait again for max. 10 ms. If 10 acknowledgments are not received during the transmission / wait period, the sending module enters fault mode.
The send / acknowledge principle is used when transferring information from the sender to the receiver, for example when the remote control sends a new setpoint to the master-motherboard. 
3.3 Unacknowledged service principle
The structure of the unacknowledged transmission principle is shown in Figure 3. The module sending the information determines to which module group the information is to be sent by setting
The content of the RECIPIENT variable is the address of the target group. What information the sender sends is indicated by setting the contents of the VARIABLE variable to the address of the register whose information is sent. The actual information is set in the DATA variable.
All modules (except the sender) listen to the bus and those modules whose group address matches the content of the RECEIVER variable receive the packet without acknowledging it in any way.

                 Figure 3. Updating the network variable with the unacknowledged transmission principle
The problem with the unacknowledged transmission principle is that the sender does not know if the information went to all the modules for which the information was intended. The unacknowledged transmission principle is used when transmitting information from a sender to multiple recipients, for example, when a remote control sends a new setpoint to other remote controls and a slave motherboard.
SYSTEM: 	This variable can be used to isolate separate systems connected to the same bus. Available in 1H-FFH (255 pcs.). Currently implemented only 1, so forced to always set to 1.

VARIABLES: The variable indicates what information is being processed.
DATA: 	The value of the VARIABLES variable. Possible values are described above in connection with the corresponding variable.
CHECKSUM: The sum of the previous bytes in 8-bit. The recipient of the packet himself adds the bytes before the checksum and compares it with the contents of the CHECKSUM variable. If the results do not match, the recipient rejects the received packet.

READ Reading a Register
A device can request a register from the master by sending
VARIABLE = 00H
	DATA	= <register code>
Power Off
If the master device is switched off (by setting Bit 0 (Power key) in register A3H, the master will still respond to READ
Broadcasts
The Master device (if not switched off) every 12 seconds broadcasts the important registers: 
2AH 2BH 2CH 32H 33H 34H 35H, eg.:
 01 11 20 2b 00 5d  01 11 20 2c 00 5e  01 11 20 35 94 fb  01 11 20 34 9c 02  01 11 20 32 73 d7  01 11 20 33 7a df  01 11 20 2a 29 85
SETTING	Writing into a Register
Experiences with Helios KWL show, that for setting a register, three recipents must be addressed in a sequence:
1.	RECIPIENT	020H (broadcast)
2.	RECIPENT	010H
3.	RECPIENT	011H
this last message MUST be followed by sending its CECKSUM twice!
	 01 21 20 a9 1f 0a	SET A9h to 1FH
 01 21 10 a9 1f fa
 01 21 11 a9 1f fb fb
Some registers will even be written with RECIPIENT 011H twice:
	 01 21 20 af a0 91	SET AFH to A0H
 01 21 10 af a0 81
 01 21 11 af a0 82
 01 21 11 af a0 82 82
User Terminal
The user terminal can not be switched via setting Bit 0 (Power key) in register A3H
The user terminal (here ID=2EH) requests data for its display every 6 seconds approx, eg.:
 01 2e 11 00 a3 e3  01 11 2e a3 09 ec	READ A3H
 01 2e 11 00 29 69  01 11 2e 29 1f 88	READ 29H
 01 2e 11 00 35 75  01 11 2e 35 94 09	READ 35H
 
VALLOX DIGIT bus protocol
 01 2e 11 00 a3 e3  01 11 2e a3 09 ec	READ A3H
 01 2e 11 00 71 b1  01 11 2e 71 00 b1	READ 71H
